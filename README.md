**Internship Week 1 - Developers Hub**
Welcome to my Week 1 internship project at Developers Hub!
This repository contains the work I completed during the first week, focusing on the foundational tools and skills essential for anyone starting in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.
Overview
During this week, I explored and practiced with key Python libraries commonly used in AI and data analysis:
Pandas: For data manipulation and handling structured data (DataFrames).
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations and array operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization, creating informative and aesthetic charts and plots.
These libraries were used for:
Data loading and preprocessing
Data wrangling and cleaning
Visualizing insights and patterns in data
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
