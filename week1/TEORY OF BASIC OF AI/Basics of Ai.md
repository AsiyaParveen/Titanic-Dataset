# Machine Learning
Machine Learning is the branch if Artificial Intelligence which focus on the machine’s development like through which they learn from data and improve its performance over time without being explicitly of the program.
# TYPES OF ML
Machine Learning contain three types:\
1-Supervised Machine Learning\
2-Un-Supervised machine Learning\
3-Reinforcement Machine Learning
# Supervised Machine Learning
Supervised Machine Learning is the type of ML in which algorithms (provide to the Machine) already trained
on the label data.\
In supervised machine learning Machine’s understand the relationship between input (features) and
correspond to its label data (output) already known.
we provide some conditions to the machine in the form of algorithm and machine make predictions or
decision make on the bases of that conditions.\
Example:\
1- Email spam vs not spam\
2- House price on the bases of location ,interior , area etc\
3- Animals features describe & then machine guest
# Algorithum used in Supervised ML
1- Linear Regression (predict continuous values )\
2- Logistic Regression (predict binary values )\
3- Neural Network (complex task predict image recognize)\
4- K-Nearest neighbors ( predict classification based on proximity neighbors\
5- Support vector machine (predict classification based on margin approach like face recognition )
# Un-supervised machine learning
Un-supervised Machine Learning is the type of ML where provide machines un-label data in the form of
cluster and the machine differtiate the data on the bases of grouping .

Example:
1-Recommender systems (e.g. grouping similar movies or products)\
2- A company wants to divide its customers into different groups based on purchasing behavior.\
3- Gene pattern analysis in biology.
# Alogorithum used in unsupervised ML
1- K-means clustering (divide data into many small resemble group)\
2- Hierarchical clustering (cluster in the form of tree)
# Reinforcement machine learning
Reinforcement is the type of ML in which machine’s learn to make decision by interacting with environment.
The agent learns through trial and error.it gets rewards or penalties based on its actions.\
Example:\
1-Teaching robots to walk, grasp objects, or navigate spaces. How RL helps: The robot learns by trial and error\
what movements are stable and effective
2-` RL helps optimize dosage in cancer treatment or insulin delivery for diabetes. How RL helps: The agent
learns which treatment decisions maximize patient health over time.
